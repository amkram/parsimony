## Introduction: 
1. Pathogen phylogenetics is important. 
+ Pathogen genome sequencing has made phylogenetics central to combatting the pandemic. Examples. 
+ The vast datasets have also shattered typical phylogenetics workflows.
+ The is a need to evaluate new (or old!) approaches for maintaining a real-time up to date phylogeny.
