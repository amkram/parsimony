# 2_optimise_starting_tree

The point here is to take the starting tree that we used to filter the data, and optimise it as rigorously as possible with two methods: likelihood and parsimony.


## 2.1 Set up the starting tree and the alignment

```
# Copy over the starting tree and the full alignment




```


## 2.2 Optimise starting tree with parsimony in IQ-TREE and/or UShER

```
```

## 2.3 Optimise starting tree with pseudo-likelihood in FastTreeMP

```
```
