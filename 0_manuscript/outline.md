# Outline:

## Introduction: 
### 1. Pathogen phylogenetics is important. 
+ Pathogen genome sequencing has made phylogenetics central to combatting the pandemic. Examples. 
+ The vast datasets have also shattered typical phylogenetics workflows.
+ The is a need to evaluate new (or in this case old!) approaches for maintaining a real-time up to date phylogeny. 

### 2. Imporant differences relative to previous pathogen tracing efforts are caused by the dramatically different pandemic sampling scheme.  
+ During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the vast scale of viral genome sequencing means that samples are often extremely genetically similar or identical. 
+ This is likely to be true in the future for all pathogen genomics efforts going forward. 
+ "State of the art" maximum likelihood approaches are expected to outperform parsimony methods when branch lengths are long. 
+ However, when branches are short, only rarely will two mutations occur on the same branch and the advantages of ML approaches is not clear.  

### 3. Parsimony is vastly faster and therefore
