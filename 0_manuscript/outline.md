# Outline:

## Introduction: 
### 1. Pathogen phylogenetics is important. 
+ Pathogen genome sequencing has made phylogenetics central to combatting the pandemic. Examples. 
+ The vast datasets have also shattered typical phylogenetics workflows.
+ The is a need to evaluate new (or in this case old!) approaches for maintaining a real-time up to date phylogeny. 

### 2. Imporant differences imposed by the current sampling scheme relative to previous approaches.  
+ During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (and likely in the future for all pathogen genomics efforts),
